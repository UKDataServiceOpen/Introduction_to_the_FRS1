These practical exercises are part of the ‘Getting started with the Family Resources Survey’ online module.

In the exercises, we use data from the Family Resources Survey (FRS), 2022-2023 financial year to:

-   Get familiar with the datasets.

-   Explore the association between variables available in different FRS datasets.

-   Assess the effect of survey weights on the results.

The exercises are divided into two section:

1.  The Hierarchical and Flat File Datasets.

2.  Merging Data and Applying Weights.

They are then divided into sub-sections based on the the statistical software used (R and SPSS).

Questions and answers are included to assess understanding of the results.
